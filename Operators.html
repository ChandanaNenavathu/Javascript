    <!-- JavaScript operators are symbols which are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more. 
The variables (operations) are called operands.
The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.
JavaScript supports the following types of operators.
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical (or Relational) Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Conditional (or ternary) Operators
6. String Operators
7. Type Operators
8. Bitwise Operators -->
